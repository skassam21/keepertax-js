# Javascript Exercise

## General Instructions

For this exercise, you are provided a starting code with empty function declarations for each of the questions in your ticket. These functions are located in the [src/generateScheduleC](./src/generateScheduleC/) directory.

Please note that there is a small Node/Express.js app in this repo that is used only for internal purposes to test your code. Please do not touch any of that code - you only need to write the solution to the functions specified in the [src/generateScheduleC](./src/generateScheduleC/) directory.

## System Requirements

The current recommended [Node.js version](https://nodejs.org/en/) is 16

## Available Scripts

In this directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the application and its requirements.

### `npm run lint`

Identifies formatting and programmatic errors in your code.

### `npm run prettier`

Auto-formats your code to keep it consistent in the repo.

### Development

Three commands have been provided for you to test your function implementations with the hardcoded data in each file. These commands will log out the return value of your functions.

To run `generateScheduleC1` for question 1:

```
npm run q1
```

To run `generateScheduleC2` for question 2:

```
npm run q2
```

To run `generateScheduleC3` for question 3:

```
npm run q3
```
